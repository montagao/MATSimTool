Tool setup

You should only need to modify the beginning "USER SETUP" portion of the MATLAB function file.
There should be comments to guide you through the setup, but in case anything is unclear:

1. Enter the values of all properties of the plot, e.g. title, legend labels, x-y labels

2. Add the filename of the PNG of your figure's image. The image should be in PNG format with a transparent background
for best results. Works best with 7:3 aspect ratio images.

3. Define the constants and variables in their respective arrays. For constants, we need only define the name in one array, and the constant value
in the matching array index in c_values. For variables, for each variable name you must also define the value limits in the corresponding row in the 'v_lims' matrix.
Note that if the limits are of 3 or more orders of magnitude apart, then the slider will increment logarithmically. This can be adjusted in the "LabelSlider.m" function file.

e.g. 

c_names = cellstr(char('Constant1', 'Constant2'));
c_values = [1 50];

v_names = cellstr(char('X Slider','V1' ));
v_lims = [ 0.1 50; 1 50  ];



If the 'XScale' variable is set to true, then the first variable modifies the max x-value displayed on the plot.

4. Specify the function x-range and y-range to display. If no 'y_lim' array is specified, then it will scale automatically.

5. User functions: (the only real work you have to do)
You must define a function file which outputs an array of y values to be plotted, using the 'v_values' and 'c_values' and x values as arguments.

An example function declaration would be 

	function v = diodeeqn( x, v_values, c_values)
	end

Save this file as a MATLAB function file and specify it in the 'user_fns' variable like so:
	user_fns = (@diodeeqn);

You can also specify to have more than one equation to be plotted.

6. Lastly you can add additional information about the specific concept being explained in the 'info' variable.

7. You should also rename the function to something more specific at the very top and save the file as the new name. (e.g. function diodeEduTool)
